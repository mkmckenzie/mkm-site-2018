# Hello!

You seem to have stumbled upon my README for my personal portfolio site. Awesome! Before you venture too far into the code, know this:
1. Yes, I know it's pretty gross on the back end. ✨
2. Please feel free to make a PR if you have feedback - I'm still learning a lot about React! 
3. This site was built with GatsbyJS - a static site generator framework that I highly recommend.

Thanks for stopping by! 
❤️ - MK
