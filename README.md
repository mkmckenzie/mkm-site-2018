# Hello!

You seem to have stumbled upon my README for my personal portfolio site. Awesome! Before you venture too far into the code, know this:
1. Please feel free to make a PR if you have feedback - I'm still learning a lot about React! 
2. This site was built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - a static site generator framework that I highly recommend.
3. This site is hosted with [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)!

Thanks for stopping by! 

❤️ - MK

### Notes for local development:

1. `yarn install` to get the packages downloaded
2. `yarn develop` runs the local server


### Notes for pushing to production:

1. `yarn build` gets the code ready for production
2. `surge` kicks off the publishing process
3. Point it to the `/public` folder
